# Development of machine learning model to predict pandemic and heart disease count

## Predictive Tool on Disease Case Count
This tool aims to support policymakers in implementing health- and socioeconomic-related policies to reduce COVID-19, heart stroke, and coronary heart cases in a selected county.How many lives can we save by improving health insurance and socioeconomic policies in our area? Our tool lets you explore on the latest data on the three diseases, compare with the state average, and predict the case counts with new policies in place

## Data Visualization
### Tableau dashboard with disease, insurance, and socioeconomic data
Compare COVID-19, heart stroke, coronary heart cases with other states and counties. Each region in the dashboard is presented with disease data and health / socioeconomic factors.

## Development of machine learning models
### XGBoost models on predicting COVID-19, Heart Stroke, and Coronary Heart Cases
How many cases of COVID-19 or heart diseases can we reduce by reducing the uninsured population by 10%? Or by reducing the unemployment rate? These are the questions that policymakers need answered to implement efficient and effective policies. With our tool, you can predict the case counts in your area by changing the parameters like uninsured population, income, unemployment, and more! Click below to try our model!
